# MovieReview-SentimentAnalysis-NaiveBayes
In this project, I have used Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classifier to perform sentiment analysis on a large set of movie review data. The dataset is a collection of labled movie reivews which was used to train as well as to predict based on the model. Further, a creation of pipeline was done to make the training as well as the prediction part easier and faster.

Prerequisites for the project:
Python-Numpy-Pandas-Naive Bayes Algorithm-Support Vector Classifier-Pipelines in Scikit Learn
